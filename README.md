Inventory Management System


About the Project
It is a Java console-based project that was developed during the Programming Fundamentals course. The system is meant to handle inventory of university including equipment, furniture, and lab items. It enables the staffs to create accounts, allocate equipment, reclaim products, track inventory, and create basic reports. The system replicates the tracking of assets that the universities use, and their availability.
Main Functions
•Enter new equipment with such information as brand, category, and warranty.
•Sign-up members of staff and store equipment assigned to staff.
•Checking availability by assigning and returning equipment.
Additional features such as search equipment by name, category and warranty range.
•Production of inventory reports and maintenance ability.
•Deal with exceptions with a personal exception types.
Technologies Used
•Java programming language
•Eclipse IDE
•GitHub for project submission
Project Structure
The project is separated into the various packages in order to organize it better:
•Models: contains all item and staff classes
•Managers: contains inventory logic and report generation
•Exceptions: contains custom exception classes
•main class: runs the menu-based system
What I Learned
Due to this project, I enhanced my perception of:
•Inheritance, polymorphism, and object-oriented programming.
•The management and storage of data using arrays.
•Loop and decision statements application in real programs.
•The development and management of custom exceptions.
•Organizing Java projects using packages
How to Run the Program
Open the project in Eclipse
•Open the project in Eclipse
•Make sure all files are inside the correct packages
•Run the InventorySystem.java file
•Follow the menu options in the console
This project made me have relaxation in basic Java and the concept of how to apply the idea of programming in working systems.
